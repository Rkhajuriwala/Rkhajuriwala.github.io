Urban planning	(Total: 150)

Hill Climbing: 49
Documentation --  7 
Score: 7

low complexity where you know answer - Does program run and give sensible output?  10
Score: 8
It runs okay, but the final result is not good enough. 

Harder problem:  should do “ok”  15
Score: 12
Again the performance is not good enough 

Is solution appropriate (urban planning should have good map)  17

Adding some comments please. Some of the naming are not informative. 
The major issue is the  performance of the program. I still figure out what cause the below-average performance. It might be the representation and scoring. This is consistent with genetic algorithm.
