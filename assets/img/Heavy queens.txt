It's running okay, but take too long to solve a 6-queen and 8 queen.

- Is solution appropriate (A* should be near optimal, greedy hill climbing should make sense)  12
Score: 10 
Not correct to calculate the branching factor in A*.

The calculation about the effective branching factor is not correct. For hill climbing, I did not get results you put in the write up.
